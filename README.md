# prediction-of-breast-cancer
The goal is to use ensembling techniques to determine whether a patient has breast cancer based on the characteristics of cell nuclei extracted from breast mass. This is a classification problem. 
The dataset consist of predictor variable, target variable and Diagnosis. The target variable contains the values "Benign" and "Malignant," where "Benign" denotes that there is no cancer or that the cells are not harmful, and "Malignant" denotes that the patient is suffering from cancer and that the cells are having a detrimental effect.
After performing EDA, various models are run and comparision has been made.
